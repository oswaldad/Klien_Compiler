Notes on the DFA’s:

The shorthand notation, !* and !), is used to denote any character that is not specified.
So, !* denotes any character that is not a *. 
Furthermore, !) denotes any character that is not a ).

The files in FA_JFLAP are .jff extension and need to be loaded by JFLAP. They are intended for personal use only.
