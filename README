The Cobras - Drake Oswald, Reed Christensen, Caiden Hauser

This project is the creation of a compiler for the simple language, Klein.  So far, the 
scanner is the only piece of the compiler we have written.

Scanner:
	Our files consist of...
		Scanner.py - This file contains the code to produce a list of tokens, 
			including the functions next() and peek().
		TokenKlein.py - This file creates a token class which we use to store what 
			type of token one is and its value (if necessary).


This compiler has no KNOWN bugs at the moment.
This compiler supports the full Klein language.
Optimizations are inapplicable at this time.
